  <!-- EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR PHOTOGRAPHY-->
  <section class="exterior photography">
   <h2>Exterior Photography</h2>
   <p>High-quality exterior photographs can help to showcase the property's curb appeal and give potential buyers a first impression of the property. These images can also help to highlight the property's unique features and selling points, such as its architecture, landscaping, and outdoor spaces.</p>
   <p>In addition, exterior photographs can help give potential buyers a sense of the property's location and surroundings. This can be especially important for properties in attractive or desirable neighborhoods, as buyers may be interested in the surrounding area as well as the property itself.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="interior photography">
   <h2>Interior Photography</h2>
   <p>High-quality interior photographs can help to showcase the property's layout, design, and finishes, giving potential buyers a clear understanding of the property's features and amenities. These images can also help to highlight the property's unique selling points, such as a spacious open floor plan, a modern kitchen, or luxurious bathrooms.</p>

  <!--MATTERPOINT VIRTUAL TOURS-->
  <section class="matterpoint virtual tours">
   <h2>Matterpoint Virtual Tours</h2>
   <p>Matterport virtual tours are a valuable tool for real estate listings because they allow potential buyers to experience a property virtually, from the comfort of their own home. This can be especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person showings may not be possible or may be limited.</p>
   <p>Matterport virtual tours provide a detailed and immersive 3D experience of a property, allowing buyers to explore the property at their own pace and from any angle. These tours can include high-quality photographs, as well as interactive floor plans and virtual walkthroughs of the property.</p>
   <p>In addition to providing a convenient and safe way for buyers to view a property, Matterport virtual tours can also help to save time and effort for both buyers and sellers. Buyers can use these tours to narrow down their options and focus on properties that meet their needs and preferences, while sellers can use them to showcase their properties to a wider audience.</p>
   <p>Overall, the use of Matterport virtual tours in real estate listings can help to increase the reach and effectiveness of a property's marketing efforts, ultimately leading to a faster sale.</p>
